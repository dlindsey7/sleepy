Still learning...

<!--more-->
Here's a list of things I've learned recently:

* [https://www.regextester.com/](RegEx Testing) is the most beautiful tool when I'm trying to think out a complicated requirement.
* [https://react-hook-form.com/](React Hook Form) has an easy to understand api and makes password validation easier.
* Go variable scope is so easy to forget when declarations are done with `:=` so... be careful!
* Error wrapping was introduced in Go 1.13. This means I can make informed decisions based on errors rather than just constantly checking `if err != nil`.
* Left to my own devices, I make some very utilitarian UIs. This is why the world needs artists.
