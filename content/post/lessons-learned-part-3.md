A list of lessons learned recently.

<!--more-->

Here's a list of things I've learned recently:

* I can work from anywhere in my house (even though I'd rather leave).
* It's not you, it's Sequel Pro.
* If your Django project doesn't recognize Django as a module, your requirements aren't installed.
* Even if you totally thought you had requirements installed.
* My commonly used tech tools might be down a little more frequently now (Zoom, GitHub, Ngrok).
* Backpedalling to Sequel Pro, I ran into [this sql import problem](https://github.com/sequelpro/sequelpro/issues/2699)
