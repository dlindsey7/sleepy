I'm learning how to use Hugo as I set up this site.

<!--more-->

The [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/ "Hugo documentation") has a pretty good **Getting Started** section. I chose the Personal Web theme because it fits my needs pretty well and I'm admittedly not a graphic designer. I can make things usable. I can't make them super pretty without an enormous amount of effort.

Currently I'm running into two issues that I hope to solve.

1. I have to hard refresh while running locally even though I can see the change being detected.
2. My husband offered to host the site for me but I'm getting some super fun 'Access Denied' errors because the url can't resolve the missing index.html.

The first issue is completely on me. The great Hugo community must have an answer somewhere. The second one could be my husband's fault (more than likely it's an AWS obscure issue that I don't need to understand). Again, the Hugo community might be able to help but I'm going to lean on his expertise since he's hosting the site. 

To Be Continued...

Spoiler alert, you'll never see this page or much of this site if I can't fix these two issues. So if you're reading this I bet there's a follow-up post saying how I did it. How did I fix it, future me? 

Edit: Future me is even more tired than past me. Future me doesn't know how to fix things but did write [Hugo, Take Two!](/post/hugo-take-two/index.html) to try to explain.
