Up, running, and ALIVE!

Kinks with AWS sorted out thanks to the assistance of a wonderfully talented Systems Reliability Engineer. Well, to be fair, I came up with a fix too. It involved setting uglyurls=true and just kinda crying about how ugly links looked. Thankfully, my fix got rolled back. Turns out Hugo is a bit ahead of the curve and AWS has this 
fun little issue where it won't return default objects within subdirectories. You can read more about that [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-default-root-object-subdirectory/) . 

I still have no idea what the hell is going on with Chrome locally. I've been less than thrilled with Chrome lately. Part of last week was spent testing a workaround because keepalive doesn't quite work yet but Chrome is still decided to [disallow sync XHR](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4664843055398912). At the very least everything refreshes correctly in Chrome with a new deploy. If I'm the only one that ever sees the problem locally, is it really a problem?

In short order Amazon and Google have let me down. I can't wait to see what the future holds and what I'll break next. Since I'm sort of keeping track now, I've only had ONE latte today (it was a fancy day). I wanted some Black Tea to keep me going but I'm fresh out so I settled for Red Tea, which is basically flavored milk.
