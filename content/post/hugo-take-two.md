Finally up and running!

<!--more-->

New year, new site! AWS issues sorted out and old template artifacts still an issue in Chrome. 
I'm not sure it's worth my time to try and sort out what's going on there. Next task will be to figure out what else
to write about (other than how much I love coffee). At this point I assume no one will ever read these posts other than myself. This is a dangerous assumption on the internet but hey, if you're reading this, look behind you.

Sorry.

More seriously, hi, hope you've found whatever you were looking for on the ol' interwebs.

Troubleshooting refresh issues:

1. Old templates and page content shows up in Chrome.
2. Doesn't happen in Safari or Firefox.
3. Correctly shows new content in Chrome only after a hard refresh.
4. Issue happens in Chrome only locally.
5. Issue happens running hugo server locally in or out of draft mode.
6. --disableFastRender does not help.
