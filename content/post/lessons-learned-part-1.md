A list of lessons learned recently.

<!--more-->

Here's a list of things I've learned recently:

* When you're debugging with Chrome, but the watch says a variable is both false and true, switch to Firefox.
* AJAX request 'always' and 'then' are a handy way to deal with errors when direct error handling isn't useful.
* Console log messages are occasionally more useful than breakpoints when dealing with concurrency.
* Abstract equality might occassionally be useful.
* [Glitch] (Glitch.com) has a cool project creation extension for VSCode.
