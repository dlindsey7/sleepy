This is an app designed to track aerial skills in order to facilitate communication between aerialists.

A common issue amongst aerialists is the fact that moves are often given different names in different countries and communities. Aerial arts are supported by a large community where people can have five different names for the exact same move. This app hopes to keep track of skill names with example images and links.
