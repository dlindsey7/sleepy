# Hey There!
This site is my collection of code snippets, things I've learned, and anything else to make programming more productive. What little free time I have is typically in the evenings which is why I've dubbed this my "sleep deprived" site. Any programmer who has dealt with scope creep, unrealistic deadlines, and late night construction noise understand how difficult it can be to focus while tired. My posts might contain some delightful digressions but there will not be recipe blog length stories to scroll through.
