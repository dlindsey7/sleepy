# Hey There!
This site is my collection of code snippets, things I've learned, and anything else to make programming more productive. What little free time I have is typically in the evenings which is why I've dubbed this my "sleep deprived" site. Any programmer who has dealt with scope creep, unrealistic deadlines, and late night construction noise understands how difficult it can be to focus while tired. My posts might contain some delightful digressions but there will not be recipe blog length stories to scroll through.

I've worked for several years in web development. My current work is focused primarily in MySQL, TypeScript, and Go. This does not mean that other languages won't make an appearance depending on what tech stack I'm dealing with at the moment.
