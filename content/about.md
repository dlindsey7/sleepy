Hi, my name is Dottie. I love problem solving. I created this site to help me keep track of late night thoughts much in the same way I take video and notes at the gym. 

I've worked in web development for several years after switching from simulation software. Sometimes I long for the days when I only needed to know a couple languages and the tech stack rarely changed. Then I remember how awful Windows was as a development environment. Kidding (mostly). To date I've spent time working in several different languages. Lately my time has been spent primarily in Typescript and Go. I have learned to adapt to whatever the client wants or the 'trending' tech.

I wrote this 'About Me' on five hours of sleep and two shots of espresso. This project is aptly named 'sleepy'.
